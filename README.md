# Connect-iQ-CGM-datafield
This is part of a term project at the Norwegian Univercity of Science and Technology, Department of Engineering Cybernetics, in collaboration with Artificial Pancreas Trondheim. The purpose is to connect Connect iQ devices with continous glucose monitors to allow logging of blood glucose along with other fitness data. This datafield combines background services, communications and fit contribution to accomplish this. 
Works with a modified version of the Nightscout Uploader, which I'll post soon.


Code is partly inspired from the samples "MoxyField" and "SimpleDataField" from the Connect iQ SDK 2.3.5. 
A more thorough text is coming..
